This program allows detection of multiple USB insertion into the Raspberry PI.<br/>

Things to note:
1. To run the program, ensure all four files are in the same folder<br/>
2. In the Makefile, ensure the KDIR path is edited to your own linux kernel source path<br/>
3. Run the commands:<br/>
   chmod +x Makefile<br/>
   chmod +x run_usb_detection.sh<br/>
5. Finally run the run_usb_detection.sh script to start the program!
