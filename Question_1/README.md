This program allows detection of multiple USB insertion into the Raspberry PI. 

Things to note:
1. To run the program, ensure all four files are in the same folder
2. In the Makefile, ensure the KDIR path is edited to your own linux kernel source path
3. Run the commands:
   chmod +x Makefile
   chmod +x run_usb_detection.sh
5. Finally run the run_usb_detection.sh script to start the program!
